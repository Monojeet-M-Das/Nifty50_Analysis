# ðŸ“Š Hybrid Time Series Forecasting using AR Model

This project forecasts Nifty 50 index prices using a hybrid time series approach. The model decomposes the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals, then applies an AutoRegressive (AR) model on the residuals.

## Features

- Download historical Nifty 50 data
- Calculate daily returns and RSI
- Decompose time series into trend/seasonal/residual
- Fit AR model on residuals
- Forecast future values by recombining components
- Visualize results with matplotlib
